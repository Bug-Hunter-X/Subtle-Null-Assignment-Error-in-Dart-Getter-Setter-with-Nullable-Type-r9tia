```dart
class MyClass {
  int? _myVariable;

  int get myVariable => _myVariable ?? 0; // Return 0 if null

  set myVariable(int value) {
    _myVariable = value;
  }
}

void main() {
  MyClass obj = MyClass();
  print(obj.myVariable); //Prints 0 as expected

obj.myVariable = 10;
  print(obj.myVariable); //Prints 10 as expected

  //The following line causes an error, but the error message isn't immediately obvious.
  obj.myVariable = null; //This will throw an error because it is an assignment to an integer.
  print(obj.myVariable); //This line won't be reached due to the error.
}
```
